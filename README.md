## Instructions for Burning DVDs

The scripts are setup on the DVD burning laptop. 

The `burn` portion of this process can only be done Monday through Friday.  It will fail for the current week if trying to do it on Sunday.

1. Check the desktop for any previous weeks' `YYYY-MM-DD_early` and `YYYY-MM-DD_DVD` folders.  Cut/Paste any found into the Archives folder.

2. Insert the SD card into the card reader. You should see the card show up on the desktop. It will have the SD Card icon. This means the card is mounted. You need to make sure the card is mounted before moving to step 3.

3. Once the SD card is in, open the Terminal application and type `copy`.

You should see the files copying over and then the DVD creation process begin. This will take 30-40 minutes to complete. Once the process has completed, you will see a command prompt with a blinking cursor.

You should now see two folders on the desktop labeled with the date.

`YYYY-MM-DD_early` and `YYYY-MM-DD_DVD`

4. The next step is to burn the DVDs. Place a blank DVD in the DVD drive and wait a few seconds for it to load. Then, open the terminal application and type `burn`.

You should see the progress of the DVD burning on the command line. When it completes, it will eject.

Place another DVD in the burner and type `burn` again in the command prompt.

5. Using a Sharpie, label each completed DVD `FBC Service - MM/DD/YYYY`.

6. Once finished burning the required number of DVDs, Cut/Paste the `YYYY-MM-DD_early` and `YYYY-MM-DD_DVD` folders to the Archives folder.
